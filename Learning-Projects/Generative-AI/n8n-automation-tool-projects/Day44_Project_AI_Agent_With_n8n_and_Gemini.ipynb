    "## Added Real-Time Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculator Node** to perform instant calculations (e.g., 17% of 2999)\n",
    "- **Shark API Node** to fetch live data from external source\n",
    "- **Memory Node** to retain chat history context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tested the Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- Asked queries like “What is 17% of 2999?” → Response was correct\n",
